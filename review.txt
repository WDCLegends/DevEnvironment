In order to gain more feedback on our initial design (as seen in sketches) we coded a small skeleton of the initial pages based on our designs and got feedback from other groups.

The feedback said our initial designs were good but could be improved to further enhance the user experience.

Specifically, the home page which was totally redesigned in order to show more to the user at once and follow fitts law.

This proved to be beneficial as when we showed the new and improved page to the group they said it was much better and a website they would use and recommend.
